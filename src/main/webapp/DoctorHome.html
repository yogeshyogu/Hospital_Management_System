        <h1>All About Doctors:</h1>
    <p>
        A doctor is no less than god this is true. 
        A lot of people think that people want to become Doctor for money but it is completely wrong as if they had then it is impossible to become a doctor. 
        For becoming a Doctor desire, satisfaction and motivation are required. Doctors spent their whole life to treat us. They do a lot of hard work and forgot 
        to sleep as well. 
        For them their patients are above everything . 
        They leave their family even when its a special occaision and a patient requires them. They are not less than God as they also give us a new life. 
        if we have any problem we directly go to them and without any discrimination they check us . Especially in the covid time where we all are sitting at 
        home they are not. 
        We sleep at night but they treat their patients. When we listen someone has corona we ger afraid and tried to maintain a distance from them whereas 
        a doctor treat them.
         They on this time are not with their families, suffering a lot of pain but still for them thier patients are everything. They can't see our sadness. 
         That mask which we want to get rid off they wear it mostly and treat their patients and for their happiness do a lot of things for us.

        Yes they are strangers too but we don't maintain distance for them instead we go and talk to them when we are sick. we feel them everything.
        
        so yes they are not god but not less than god too</p>
